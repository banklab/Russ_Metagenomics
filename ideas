similar community 8-10 so biotic does not conflate LA

top candidate vs top snp only - difference between detect outliers by SGV vs de novo mutation
- also soft sweeps will be better detected (less detected with TC)

LA adaptation within such small space - increased diversity of entire metacommunity - increased adaptability of entire metacommunity

lots of studies talking about microbiome's stability - but we show changes even over small space

if studies just look at communities - no change from env 8 to 10 - without looking at snps miss out on the adaptation




Fst change at each outlier in each deer
Allele freq change (sup mat)
Pi difference at each outlier

For each outlier species - look at divergence between each deer at neutral regions - ie, are the adaptive mutations de novo or common ancestor
