similar community 8-10 so biotic does not conflate LA

top candidate vs top snp only - difference between detect outliers by SGV vs de novo mutation

LA adaptation within such small space - increased diversity of entire metacommunity - increased adaptability of entire metacommunity

lots of studies talking about microbiome's stability - but we show changes even over small space

if studies just look at communities - no change from env 8 to 10 - without looking at snps miss out on the adaptation
