purpose: assemble processed samples into genome assemblies
tool: metaSPADES (doi: 10.1101/gr.213959.116)
parameters: I used metagenome mode (--meta) and kmer lengths 21,33,55,77 (-k)

1) edit input and output directories in code
2) I used "R1.dedup.fastq" as naming convention for all my read 1's, adjust as neccessary
3) run 01_MAKE_METASPADES_SH.R to make sh scripts
4) submit sh scripts on command line 



Quantify_Length_Cov
purpose: quantify the length and coverage of each assembly

Filter_Assembly
purpose: filter each assembly according to length and coverage
