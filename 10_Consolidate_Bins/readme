This step takes the results from multiple different binning tools and finds the best results from ALL tools (and combinations of tools)

Scripts are borrowed from metaWRAP (Uritskiy et al. 2018)


Consolidate bins
purpose: take bins sets from different programs, compare analagous bins from the different programs, decide on the best bin from each comparison

see: github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP/blob/master/bin/metawrap-scripts/consolidate_two_sets_of_bins.py


Dereplicate contigs
purpose: find and remove duplicated contigs to ensure that each contig is only assigned to one bin

see: github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP/blob/master/bin/metawrap-scripts/dereplicate_contigs_in_bins.py
