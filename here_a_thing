redo gene metrics script - add maj/min af
fix tajimas d script so pi is called properly
2_10_bin.9 outlier peak - gaia says transposase is5377 -- cannot find (blast) this IS sequence in genome or in raw data (IS sequence is from different phylum though)

finish remaining gene metrics/tajimas jobs on server
figure out plotting nucleotide div heatmaps, so genes are same size, and plot top to bottom
taxonomy of top species and outlier species, many faecousia species - fisher test says more than expected, is this genus more locally adaptive?
fastANI of top species - make sure they are all different species - the closest one is 90% ani - so safe
finished tajima's D calculations
code tajima's D - if I guess at population size and get it wrong does it change the identify of tajima's D value (positive vs negative)?
Claudia meet
resubmit diversity jobs, with maj/min af at every site

jan 8
doublecheck new gene metrics, diversity results
backup diversity stuff to storage
code to count minor alleles
code to calculate PBS from FST data

jan 9
proctor student exam
fix MAF should be na not 0, when S==0

jan 10
tajima's D other environments (1:7)
PBS by gene for top 82 species
PBS plot

jan 11
code combined plots - cmh + pi/maf/pbs for all deer and both env
PBS epiphany - the PBS for CMH outliers is 0 - why? because CMH preferentially identifies loci with CONCORDANT signal across the ~7 deer, so the signal is concordant so therefor the locus is NOT diverged between deer, because it is not diverged PBS=0
So the CMH outliers being centred on 0 for PBS is actually accurate
