redo gene metrics script - add maj/min af
fix tajimas d script so pi is called properly
2_10_bin.9 outlier peak - gaia says transposase is5377 -- cannot find (blast) this IS sequence in genome or in raw data (IS sequence is from different phylum though)

finish remaining gene metrics/tajimas jobs on server
figure out plotting nucleotide div heatmaps, so genes are same size, and plot top to bottom
taxonomy of top species and outlier species, many faecousia species - fisher test says more than expected, is this genus more locally adaptive?
fastANI of top species - make sure they are all different species - the closest one is 90% ani - so safe
finished tajima's D calculations
code tajima's D - if I guess at population size and get it wrong does it change the identify of tajima's D value (positive vs negative)?
Claudia meet
resubmit diversity jobs, with maj/min af at every site

jan 8
doublecheck new gene metrics, diversity results
backup diversity stuff to storage
code to count minor alleles
code to calculate PBS from FST data

jan 9
proctor student exam
fix MAF should be na not 0, when S==0

tajima's D other environments (1:7)
PBS by gene for top 82 species
PBS plot

code combined plots - cmh + pi/maf/pbs for all deer and both env
PBS epiphany - the PBS for CMH outliers is 0 - why? because CMH preferentially identifies loci with CONCORDANT signal across the ~7 deer, so the signal is concordant so therefor the locus is NOT diverged BETWEEN deer, because it is not diverged PBS=0
So the CMH outliers being centred on 0 for PBS is actually accurate

jan 12
PBS - what explains loci that are pos B and neg A -- this would be migration back from 10 into 8 but this doesn't make sense
- it seems like it should be selection - but not repeated between deer - check FST values for these loci are they very disparate between deer
- maybe these are locally adaptive loci with high redundancy

jan 13
PBS try to understand
add Fst between 8-10 within same deer to PBS

make ppt for florian day 1 pitch
PCA species abundances
bar plots for phylum abundances
make Fig 1

jan 16
AF at outlier snps, and get bracketing snps
call snps at 8x9 env, and 9x10 env

jan 17
combining snps, filter snps
adding 8-9 snps and 9-10 snps to my bracketing snps thing
figure out intergenic outliers - install meme suite and download databases of known prok regulator sequences, transcription binding sequences etc

jan 19 
rewriting my cmh manhattan plot function with ggplot instead of my old one from MSc

jan 20
plotting all CMH species on same plot instead of ggarranging 20 different plots
PBS results to 'focus group'

CMH plot outliers by functions
took this out afterall ####fix scaffolds in CMH plotting - scaffold number is coming from assembly - and then the different numbers get binned into species - so only one species from a given assmebly has Scaffold 1, only one species has Scaffold 2 etc - so this means there are gaps on the genome of each species if you try and count 1 to n etc - fix so at least when plotting the scaffolds go 1,2,...n

PBS negative values??

jan 22
Change CMH outlier thresholds - revert SNP thresh back to 20k, and change qvalue min to 0.05 (before 0.10) -- this keeps 10 outlier species still but switches out the worst guy for a different worst guy
  I lose that energy/carbohydrate metabolism outlier but I think the threshold sounds better like this
cmh plot, trying to fix the gaps, why are they there ## nevermind they are supposed to be here
CMH labels by species now
CMH change how outlier intergenic are highlighted now that not using dbinom, highlight flanking 810 nt, because 810 nt is median gene size
Florin slim code
update "make outlier df" code - to add top snp in each gene

jan 23
FIG 3 (cmh all species, with functions)
grading the exams

FIG 3 and caption
Fig 3 - 2nd version label each outlier and make table with outlier functions? this is not working yet
PBS - bug check, figure out why negative values

jan 25
PBS by gene - mean all fst at gene first then PBS - rerun pbs
