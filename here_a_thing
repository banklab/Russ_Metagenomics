redo gene metrics script - add maj/min af
fix tajimas d script so pi is called properly
2_10_bin.9 outlier peak - gaia says transposase is5377 -- cannot find (blast) this IS sequence in genome or in raw data (IS sequence is from different phylum though)

finish remaining gene metrics/tajimas jobs on server
figure out plotting nucleotide div heatmaps, so genes are same size, and plot top to bottom
taxonomy of top species and outlier species, many faecousia species - fisher test says more than expected, is this genus more locally adaptive?
fastANI of top species - make sure they are all different species - the closest one is 90% ani - so safe
finished tajima's D calculations
code tajima's D - if I guess at population size and get it wrong does it change the identify of tajima's D value (positive vs negative)?
