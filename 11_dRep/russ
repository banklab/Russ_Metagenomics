BACKGROUND:

Something to keep in mind is that when multiple closely related genomes are present in a sample, the assembly algorithm can break and you can fail to recover genomes from either organism. A solution to this problem is to assemble and bin genomes from all metagenomic samples individually, and dereplicate the genome set at the end. -InStrain documentation

Independent assembly should generate more and higher-quality genomes than the co-assembly based approach because the complexity of individual samples is lower than that of the combination of samples. The challenge that arises from independent assembly is that de-replication of the resulting genome set is required. Olm et al. 2017 (This is the dRep paper)
