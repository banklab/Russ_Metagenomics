purpose: compare all genomes (from all samples at once) and identify replicate genomes, choose the best representative genome from replicates, discard the others
tool: dRep (doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2017.126)
parameters: I filtered on 70% completion (-comp) & 10% contamination (-con)
  - mash sketch size 10000 (-ms)
  - 80% average nucleotide identity (ANI) for primary clusters (-pa) and 95% for secondary clusters (-sa)
  - 30% minimum overlap between genomes when comparing (-nc)
  - included genome size when scoring genomes (-sizeW)
